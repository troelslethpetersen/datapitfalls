## What is this?

**datapitfalls** is an open-source tool that detects the common blunders in your data work that trip up even seasoned practitioners — and its pitfall taxonomy spans the *entire* data reasoning chain, from the question you start with to the chart you finish with, not just the final pixels.

Most "chart linters" stop at the pixels: they'll tell you your axis is truncated or your colors fail a contrast check. That's useful, but it's a sliver of where data work actually goes wrong. The most consequential mistakes happen *upstream* — in how a question is framed, how data is collected, how it's transformed, how it's analyzed, and how the results are finally interpreted and communicated. A perfectly formatted chart built on a cherry-picked timeframe is still misleading. A flawless SQL query that silently drops nulls still lies.

Its pitfall catalog spans the whole chain:

> **question formulation → data collection → transformation → analysis → visualization → interpretation → communication**

It's powered by the [Claude API](https://www.anthropic.com/) and grounded in the pitfall taxonomy from the book [*Avoiding Data Pitfalls*](https://www.avoidingdatapitfalls.com) (Wiley) by Ben Jones. Give it a chart, a code snippet, a plain-English description of your analysis, or a whole report — and it returns a structured audit that names the pitfalls, explains *why* they matter, and tells you how to fix them.

Today you scan one piece at a time — a chart (or several together), a code snippet, a description, or a single document (a PDF report is read end-to-end, prose and charts alike). Detecting pitfalls across a connected, multi-stage workflow as one linked chain is on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

This is not a style checker. It's a thinking partner for anyone who wants to work with data more honestly.

## The 8 Pitfall Domains

datapitfalls organizes every pitfall into one of eight domains — the pitfall categories from *Avoiding Data Pitfalls*. Together they span the full arc of a data project.

## Quick Start

datapitfalls is designed around **four input modes**, so you can scan your work at whatever stage you're in.

> ⚠️ **Status:** The datapitfalls **detection engine is live**, and you can use it two ways. The **command line** scans chart images, code snippets, and plain-English descriptions (modes 1–3 below), with a `--ci` exit code for pipelines. A **web app** (in [`web/`](web/)) does all of that in the browser and adds **document upload** — PDF read natively (so Claude reviews the prose *and* the charts and tables), Word `.docx`, **PowerPoint `.pptx` decks**, Jupyter notebooks, and code files — plus **multi-chart scans** that compare several charts at once. The web app is per-IP rate-limited, and your input is sent to the Claude API to run the scan but isn't stored by the app. Install the CLI and engine with `npm install datapitfalls`, or run the web app locally with `cd web && npm run dev`. Still planned: a public site at [avoidingdatapitfalls.com](https://www.avoidingdatapitfalls.com) — see the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

### 1. Scan a chart image

```bash
npx datapitfalls scan ./quarterly-revenue.png
```

Upload a chart and let Claude Vision flag truncated axes, misleading encodings, missing context, and accessibility issues.

### 2. Paste a code snippet (Python / SQL / R)

```bash
npx datapitfalls scan ./transform.sql
```

```sql
-- datapitfalls will flag the silent inner-join filtering below
SELECT u.id, o.total
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;  -- users with no orders silently disappear
```

### 3. Describe an analysis in plain English

```bash
npx datapitfalls scan --text "We compared this year's signups to last year's, \
but only counted users who are still active today."
```

datapitfalls recognizes the survivorship bias hiding in that sentence.

### 4. Upload a report — or several charts at once (web app)

In the web app, drop in a **PDF report** and Claude scans the whole thing in context — the written claims *and* the charts and tables on the page (Word `.docx`, **PowerPoint `.pptx` decks**, Jupyter notebooks, and code files work too). Or add **several chart images** together for a multi-chart scan that catches pitfalls across them: inconsistent scales, inconsistent encodings, and contradictory messages.

---

## Installation

```bash
# Install as a project dependency
npm install datapitfalls

# …or run the CLI without installing
npx datapitfalls scan ./my-chart.png
```

You'll need an API key for the LLM provider you want to use. By default datapitfalls uses [Anthropic Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/); it also supports [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/). Set the corresponding key in your environment:

```bash
# default — Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# or use OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
datapitfalls scan --provider openai ./my-chart.png

# or use Google Gemini
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
datapitfalls scan --provider gemini ./my-chart.png
```

PDFs are sent natively to every provider (so the model reviews the prose *and* the charts and tables on each page), and the pitfall catalog is cached via each provider's caching mechanism so repeated scans only pay full price for the per-request artifact.

> datapitfalls requires Node.js **18 or later**.

---

## Programmatic API

Beyond the CLI, datapitfalls is a library you can build on. The core is
`detectPitfalls()`, which scans an artifact (or a whole analysis chain) and
returns a structured report:

```ts
import { detectPitfalls, formatReport, hasBlockingFindings } from 'datapitfalls';

const report = await detectPitfalls(
  { kind: 'code', content: 'SELECT AVG(rate) FROM metrics;', language: 'SQL' },
  { apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }
);

console.log(formatReport(report));
if (hasBlockingFindings(report)) process.exit(1);
```

The package is ESM-only and ships its own TypeScript types. See the **[API
reference](docs/API.md)** for the full supported surface — inputs, report
shape, file routing, taxonomy queries — and the API-stability policy.

## How It Works

```
   ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
   │  Your input  │ ──▶ │  Pitfall         │ ──▶ │  Claude API  │ ──▶ │  Structured      │

   │  chart       │     │                  │     │              │     │                  │

   │  description │     │  relevant rules  │     │  input +     │     │  severity, why   │
   │  document    │     │  from 8 domains  │     │  taxonomy    │     │  it matters, fix │
   └──────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
```

1. **You provide input** — a chart, a code snippet, a description, or a document.
2. **Taxonomy lookup** — datapitfalls pulls the relevant pitfall rules from its catalog of eight pitfall domains.
3. **Claude API analysis** — Claude reasons over your input *and* the pitfall taxonomy, grounded in the knowledge from *Avoiding Data Pitfalls*.
4. **Structured pitfall report** — you get back a clear, prioritized list of pitfalls: what was found, how severe it is, why it matters, and how to fix it.

For the full technical picture, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Based on the Book

datapitfalls is the software companion to [**_Avoiding Data Pitfalls: How to Steer Clear of Common Blunders When Working with Data and Presenting Analysis and Visualizations_**](https://www.avoidingdatapitfalls.com) by **Ben Jones** (Wiley, 2020).

The book distills two decades of teaching and practice into a map of where data work goes wrong — and that map is the foundation of this tool's pitfall taxonomy. Every rule datapitfalls applies traces back to a pitfall described in the book.

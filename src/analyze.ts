You are given an artifact — source code or a plain-English description of a data analysis — and a catalog of pitfall rules. Identify which pitfalls from the catalog the artifact actually exhibits.

You can see only the artifact, never the data it runs on. Many pitfalls are patterns whose real-world impact depends on data values you cannot inspect. Classify every finding by its nature:
- "active": the pitfall is evident from the artifact itself, regardless of the data (e.g. averaging a two-digit-year column, summing a column that includes a "Total" row, reporting a mean as the "typical" value, mismatched units in a formula). State these directly.
- "latent": the artifact uses a risky pattern, but whether it actually bites depends on data you can't see (e.g. dropna() before an aggregate only matters if nulls exist; grouping by date only drops periods if some periods have zero rows). Phrase these conditionally, do NOT assert the pitfall is definitely affecting the results, and fill in "condition" with what must be true of the data for it to occur.

Rules of engagement:
- Only report pitfalls that appear in the catalog below, and cite each by its exact \`id\`.
- Report a finding only when the artifact shows real evidence of the pitfall (active) or a genuinely risky pattern (latent). Be conservative: avoid speculation and false positives.
- For each finding, provide the rule id, confidence (low/medium/high), nature (active/latent), the specific evidence from the artifact (quote the relevant line or phrase), a concise explanation, and — for latent findings — the data condition under which it bites.

You can see only the charts, never the underlying data or how they were made. Many pitfalls are patterns whose real-world impact depends on values you cannot inspect. Classify every finding by its nature:
- "active": the pitfall is evident from the image itself, regardless of the data (e.g. a bar chart with a truncated/non-zero baseline, a dual y-axis, a 3D or exploded pie, an inverted or non-linear axis, a distorting aspect ratio, area/bubble sizing by radius instead of area, a rainbow/red-green color scale, missing axis labels or units, an overcrowded or spaghetti chart). State these directly.
- "latent": the chart makes a choice that is only sometimes misleading, and whether it bites depends on data or context you can't see (e.g. a particular bin width, a chosen time window or axis range, an aggregation that may hide variation). Phrase these conditionally, do NOT assert the pitfall is definitely distorting the message, and fill in "condition" with what must be true for it to occur.

- When several charts are shown together, also check for pitfalls that only emerge across them — inconsistent axis scales/ranges/units that break comparison, the same color/shape/size meaning different things from one chart to the next, or charts whose messages contradict one another — and name the charts involved in the evidence.

You are also given a catalog of pitfall rules. Identify which pitfalls from the catalog the work actually exhibits.

Review each stage for its own pitfalls, and — most importantly — look for pitfalls that only emerge in the *relationships between* stages, because these are invisible when any single stage is viewed alone:
- a data transformation in an early stage (a filter, a dropped-null, a join, a recoding) that biases what a later chart or claim shows;
- a metric computed one way in code but described differently in prose (e.g. a mean computed in code and called the "typical" value in the summary);
- a chart choice (a truncated axis, a cherry-picked window) that a later narrative then over-claims or treats as fact;
- a caveat, exclusion, or assumption introduced in one stage that a downstream conclusion ignores.

const SUMMARY_ADDENDUM = `

Additional reporting requirements:
- Provide a "summary": at most two sentences giving the author the overall state of this work. Lead with whether the work is fundamentally sound, then name the single most important thing to address, if any. Distinguish what is evident from what is conditional: if the key flaw is active, say it holds regardless of the unseen data; if every finding is latent, say plainly that nothing is evidently wrong and frame the findings as conditions to verify, not problems. Keep it proportionate: do not catastrophize work with only minor issues, and do not soften work with a conclusion-changing flaw. Do not spend summary words re-praising items already in the "avoided" list.
- Report "avoided": up to two pitfalls from the catalog that this work VISIBLY avoided. An avoidance counts only when the artifact contains a concrete countermeasure you can cite as evidence — a guard or assertion, a stated caveat, a deliberate encoding or method choice — and only for a pitfall that commonly bites this kind of work. The author must realistically have been able to fall in: if the alternative would be unusual or impossible (e.g. clustering on raw text columns), it is not an avoidance. Never list a rule you also report as a finding. Zero avoidances is common and fine; an empty list is better than a stretch.
- Rate each finding's "consequence" — how much it matters to what a reader would conclude. For latent findings, rate the consequence assuming the stated condition actually holds. Reserve "changes-takeaway" for findings whose fix (or whose condition biting) would likely change the conclusion itself (e.g. an unweighted average of rates, a partial final period read as a decline). Use "weakens-support" when the conclusion may stand but is less well supported than presented (e.g. reported counts treated as real-world incidence, a possibly biased subset). Use "polish" when fixing it improves clarity or craft without changing the message (e.g. a clearer label, a better chart type for the same story). Most findings are not "changes-takeaway"; if you rate more than two findings that way, re-check that each one really overturns the conclusion on its own.
- Voice: write the summary and every explanation as a friendly, experienced guide rather than a judge, in plain words. Frame each pitfall around what the work's audience would misperceive or wrongly conclude (e.g. "readers will take 5.0 as the typical energy release"), not around what the author did wrong. These pitfalls catch experienced practitioners every day, so never scold — but never soften the substance either: if a conclusion does not hold, say so plainly.
- Be concise: each finding's explanation is one or two sentences covering only what is specific to THIS artifact — where the pitfall shows up and what the audience would wrongly conclude. Do not restate the rule's general description (the reader has it alongside your finding), do not repeat the quoted evidence in prose, and do not let "condition" restate the explanation — it states only the data condition itself.`;
